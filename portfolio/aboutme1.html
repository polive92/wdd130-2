        <div class="main-text">
            <p>Since 2019 I have been learning about software and web development. I graduated from BYU-Pathway and moved onto BYU-Idaho for my Bachelors in Computer Science. I'm currently still in school for my degree but I would love to intern for a great company looking for someone who is driven and eagar to learn. When I'm not typing away at a computer, you will find me with my family, my husband, my cats, in nature, or at church. I have been married for five years and I live in Utah with my husband and three cats. Yes, you read that right, I absolutely love cats. Some call me the crazy cat lady and I'm completely okay with that. I love being outdoors and I love to travel. I have been to various States and Countries over the years. My favorite destination so far is Tonga, the island my parents originate from. Speaking of Tonga, my family and culture play a huge role in who I am today, and as you saw from my homepage, I opened with a common Tongan greeting. "Mālō e lelei" (mah-low eh leh-lay) means many things like "Hello", "Welcome", "Good Afternoon" to name a few. I am very connected to my roots and I believe that sets me apart because I have yet to see a lot of Polynesian women in the world of S.T.E.M and I hope to change that. My heritage is also deeply connected in Faith, I served a full-time LDS mission in North Carolina and it has taught me things that a secular education couldn't. God is very important to me and plays a huge role in my character and the decsions I make.</p>
