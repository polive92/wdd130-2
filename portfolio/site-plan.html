      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Since 2019 I have been learning about software and web development. I graduated from BYU-Pathway and moved onto BYU-Idaho for my Bachelors in Computer Science. I'm currently still in school for my degree but I would love to intern for a great company looking for someone who is driven and eagar to learn. When I'm not typing away at a computer, you will find me with my family, my husband, my cats, in nature, or at church. I have been married for a litte over five years and I live in Utah with my husband and three cats. Yes, you read that right, I absolutely love cats. Some call me the crazy cat lady, and I'm completely okay with that. I love to be outdoors and I love to travel. I have been to various States and Countries. My favorite place I have traveled to so far is Tonga, the island my parents originate from. Speaking of Tonga, my family and culture play a huge role in who I am today, as you probably saw from my homepage, I opened with a common Tongan greeting. "Mālō e lelei" (mah-low eh leh-lay) means many things like "Hello", "Welcome", "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon" etc. I am very connected to my roots and I believe that sets me apart because I have yet to see many Polynesian women in the world of S.T.E.M and I hope to change that. My heritage is also deeply connected in Faith, I served a full-time LDS mission in North Carolina and it has taught me things that a secular education couldn't. God is very important to me and plays a huge role in my character as a person and the decsions I make.

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
       Here is an example of my work below. My experience is limited but with the help of your company offering me an intern position, I can expand my portfolio and learn so much more. I also linked the live github page. This example was done in a web development class where we learned how to write code for HTML and CSS. We also learned how to position text and images on a website. I can confidently say that I have learned how to build a site from the ground up and how colors and fonts make a huge difference in the user experience. I learned that colors should have a complimentary contrast and fonts should be selected carefully depending on the audience and purpose of the website. In this particualr example, we built a site that was for a water rafting site. My goal for the fonts and colors I chose was to reflect earthy tones because of the outdoor nature of the site. I also wanted it to look professional and neat. I chose this font because it looked like "waves" with the way it has sublte curves and I feel that it gave the site more character and a certain element of "fun". After all, this was supposed to attract adventurous people.
