    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to expand our presence online and sell our customers an experience they will never forget. We have been in business for decades and our presence online isn't as strong as other companies and I want that to change. I call it an "experience" because I want it to be more than just a day of river rafting for our customers. I want them to feel comfortable and safe throughout the process, from renting equipment all the way down to the rafting expedition itself. I want them to walk away happy with core memories that will last forever. I believe that by shifting our focus to giving our customers an experience and building this webiste accordingly, we will be able to increase our revenue and longevity in this industry for many more decades to come. .</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The type of audience that we will be catering to is families and social media influencers. I want us to keep in mind that not only do we want families and adventurous people to be attracted to our website, I also want to keep a sense of professionalism when building our site. I don't want to take away from the fact that we want the average consumer to feel like this will be a fun outting for family and freinds but I do want it to look modern and professional while still looking fun. The colors should be neutrals and pastels but should remain readable, as to catch the eye of a social media content creator looking for a instagrammable experience. The font should be clear and professional so that families can feel confident in trusting us. I want this site to find a happy medium between the two.</p>
